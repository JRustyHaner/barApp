Changes from original diagram:

- Rename the Drink model to Recipe in order to match sitemap.
- Combined attributes of drinkPicture and drinkRecipe models into Recipe model and removed them, because having them didn't provide and need feature and just added complexity.
- Added drinkType to Recipe to allow was searching by drink type.
